    <h3>  NON-DEFAULT NUMBER SELECTOR </h3>

    In addition to the simulated dice game with 6, 12, and 20-sided dice, players have the option of playing Score! with four random numbers having the upper bounds of their choice.  A 7-sided die wouldn't roll nicely and a 53-sided one would be hard to make, but 7 tne 53 are valid choices in random number play. So is four 15's. When the upper-bounds of the four random numbers change, players might want to also change the "Score Number"; that is, the number which bangs the gong and wins a point.  If players wanted four upper bounds of 100 each, they might want to continue trying to find ways to arrive at 20, but they might want to try for 150 instead.  A "Score Number" box is included below for selecting score numbers.

        <h3>Educational Tool</h3>
        <p>Students can practice using negative numbers by selecting the "intermediate" level of evaluation.
            For example, 3, 5, 11, and 11 has solutions involving subtraction and addition of negative numbers.
            Students can practice multiplying and dividing by fractions by selecting the "complex" level of
        evaluation. Some of the solutions to 2, 3, 9, and 14 involve fractions.</p>
        <p>Looking for errors in the computer's output can be engaging and educational. When a solution that
        look wrong at first turns out to be correct, a student has learned something. Students who find at least
            one error are entitled to receive an "Expert Beta Tester" certificate signed by Alex and David Schalk.</p>
        <h3> Rules: </h3>
        <p>Four dice are rolled. The numbers are shown on the top and bottom rows.
            Operators are shown in the middle row.  If a player clicks SCORE, that player has 30 seconds in which
            to explain how the operators can be used on three or four dice to arrive at the number 20.  This can
            be accomplished in two, or three stages. If you make a 20 (4x5, 10+10, etc.) with the first
            calculation, the round isn't over.  You have used only two dice.  If you have two identical numbers,
            say 6's, you can divide 6 into 6 the then multiply the 1 you get times the twenty and, Score!  You
            could also add 6 and then subtract the other 6. Zero's aren't allowed, so DO NOT subtract 6 from the
            other six and add the 0 to twenty.  Acdnytime that is possible, the other two methods will be available.
            If you have two consecutive numbers, you can subtract to get a 1. If the roll is 1, 2, 12, 20, you
            can concatenate the 1 behind the 2, divide that by 12, and multiply the resulting 1 times 20.  If
            you do it in 30 seconds or less, Score!  After each preliminary calculation is performed, the new
            numbers are displayed and the countdown continues. The default dice denominations are 6, 6, 12,
            and 20, corresponding to the most symetical yet large enough to be readable physical dice.  </p><p>
            You can put any numbers you like in the boxes to the left, such as 9, 9, 9, 9 (solution: concatenate,
            divide, and add), but those numbers would never come up using the default dice since two of them have
            only six sides. If players agree to change that, or if a solo player wants to see random rolls of
            non-default dice combinations, the boxes below can be used to change the denominations of the game dice.
        </p><p>IMPOSSIBLE: If a player clicks IMPOSSIBLE, the other players have 60 seconds in which to click
            SCORE and then show a solution withing 30 seconds.  Clicking Score and not showing an answer within
            30 seconds or clicking IMPOSSIBLE and having someone else score result in the loss of a point.
            Clicking SCORE and entering a solution within 30 seconds increases a player';s score by one point.<br><br>
            A browser that loads the game registers as player "Fred." I more than one browser is online, there is
            only one Fred.  If someone is not competing, but just evaluating rolls, that player automatically becomes "Solo,"
            as all can see on the scoreboard.
